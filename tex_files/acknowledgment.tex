The scientific goal of our laboratory was to develop a LiDAR with an extremely small size and mass
that could be used in the future for autonomous lunar and Mars rovers or as a docking LiDAR on
spaceships. I started my work with a MEMS pinhole LiDAR experimental setup and was a project
leader of later single device prototype development.
Within two years of work, it was shown that a MEMS pinhole LiDAR concept works for both distance
measurement and color 2D image scanning. Such a LiDAR has similar key parameters as modern
commercially available devices. However, it has ~100 times less mass and several times less size.
Therefore, MEMS pinhole LiDAR submodules may be added to any spacecraft without decreasing its
payload mass.
