\section{General about lidar \& why it's important for rover navigation \& terrain mapping}
\section{About methods of navigation (probably chapter Related work)} 
\section{About application more deeply (probably chapter Related work)}
\section{Analogues \& why we are better}
\section{About ISS-gamma mission(can be checked in space) \& Lunar mission in the future in case of ISS-gamma success (about Lunar environment)}
When using the  and \\chapter tags in LaTeX you will typically end up with parts and chapters that say “part” and “chapter” before the name you have written. Putting these lines in your preamble will remove this:

\chapter{Related Work (skipped?)}

\chapter{Implementation}
\section{Lidar principle \& schematic}
\section{Calculating the SNR for the Moon?}
\section{Submodule components}
\subsection{Laser module}
\subsubsection{Laser}
\subsubsection{Laser driver}
\subsubsection{Laser collimator}

\subsection{MEMS, our driver + some params from datasheets}
\subsubsection{photo of trajectories}
