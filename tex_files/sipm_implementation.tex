\section{SiPM module}
\subsection{SiPM detector}
The Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) is a single-photon sensitive sensor that has
performance characteristics comparable to a conventional ICCD/PMT/APD (Table ~\ref{tbl:sipm_comparison}).
with the practical advantages of a solid-state sensor.

It is formed of a summed array of closely-packed Single Photon Avalanche Photodiode (SPAD) sensors (Fig. \ref{fig:sipm_structure})

\begin{figure}[H]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{sipm_structure}}
\caption{An SiPM consists of an array of microcells
(SPAD plus quench resistor) with summed output.}
\label{fig:sipm_structure}
\end{figure}


The SiPM is operated in Geiger-mode which enables high gain
(1x106), high detection efficiency (>50\%) and fast timing
(sub-ns rise times) at moderate bias (~30V). This is achieved by creating a high
field region in the diode that generates a self-perpetuating charge
avalanche when a photon is absorbed. Passive
quenching, is achieved through the use of a
series resistor which limits the current drawn by the diode during
breakdown. This lowers the reverse voltage seen by the diode to a
value below its breakdown voltage, thus halting the avalanche. The
diode then recharges back to the bias voltage, and is available to
detect subsequent photons.


Since the capacitance of the microcell will depend upon its area, the reset time will vary for different microcell sizes, with a 50mm
microcell SiPM having a significantly longer reset time and gain than a 10mm microcell SiPM.
Another one of the most important parameter is PDE (Photon Detection Efficiency). This is the product of the $QE\cdot AIP \cdot FF$, where $QE$ is quantum efficiency, $AIP$ is the avalanche initiation probability and $FF$ is the fill factor of the microcells.
The characteristics and PDE graph of the selected SiPM detector by Sensl are shown in the table \ref{tbl:sipm_characteristics} and figure \ref{fig:sipm_pde} correspondingly.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|p{0.2\linewidth}|p{0.3\linewidth}|}
\hline

In accordance with the characteristics of the detector, we can say that it is ideally suited for the LiDAR based on TOF technology. High gain and small rise time allows sigle-detection mode with high SNR, while small recharge time allow very high repetition rate, up to 10MHz.

\subsection{SiPM collimator}
Receiver optics is one of the most important in the whole system. It provides a specified FOV, minimizing noise. Our receiver aperture is limited by diameter of the MEMS, so it should not exceed 3.6mm.
Since we don't need wide FOV we are not suffering so much due to abberrations, thus the optical system consists of one aspherical lens to focus received signal to SiPM and a pinhole for cutting FOV according to eq:\ref{eq:sipm_FOV}.
FOV of SiPM should be big enough to cover laser beam, but at the same time should be quite small to decrease noise impact.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:sipm_FOV}
FOV = 2\cdot tan^{-1}(\frac{d}{2\cdot f})
\end{equation}
Where d is pinhole size, f is focal length.

Acoording Zemax simulation, the FOV will be $2.8{^\circ}x2.8{^\circ}$,
thus we have tolerance for match both laser FoV and SiPM to cover fast axis of laser beam $(0.1{^\circ}x2.5{^\circ}$).
